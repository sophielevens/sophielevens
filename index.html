<h1 id='about' class='title'>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p class="para">Hey! I’m Sophie. I like being outside, learning new things
and watching the sunset. I'm happiest when I've just completed an algorithm
or I’m making someone smile.

<p class = "para">Over the past two years I've been to nine different countries. My first
backpacking ramble took me to Southeast Asia for six months before spending
a year working in and travelling around Australia’s beautiful coast. I love
the lifestyle over there and one day I hope to go back! While travelling
I've had some once-in-a-lifetime experiences, learnt some serious life
lessons and now I'm teaching myself to code. My interest in Front End
Development began while I was at university in Bath, where I studied
English Literature with Digital Publishing. Now I’ve delved a little
deeper into programming I’ve developed my love for Front End but also have
a real appreciation for JavaScript’s functionality.</p>

<p class = "para">My most recent adventure took me to India for four months where I was
volunteering for a UN recognised women's empowerment organisation. This
trip was horrifying and inspiring (and everything in between), and has
spurred me to actively pursue a future role in a non-profit organisation.</p>

<h1 id='blog1' class='title'>WHY IT SUCKS TO BE THE FRIEND WHO TRAVELS</h1>
<p class = "para"> People don’t really talk about the negatives of
long-term travel and I don’t know why. Perhaps they’re scared to
complain while living it up on a beach in Bali because people will
think they’re being ridiculous, but I want to set the record
straight: long term travel has it’s downsides and I’d like to shed
some light on my least favourite bits.</p>

<h2>Missing Major Milestones</h2>

<p class="para">I write this as my little sister’s 18th birthday is
looming – a HUGE turning point in any teenager’s life – and I wont
be there. Again. I’ve lost count of the celebrations that I’ve
missed while I’ve been on my adventure – babies being born,
weddings, funerals, heartbreaks, housewarmings, engagements – you
name it, I’ve missed it.I’m sure my friends and family have adapted to my
absence (it has been two years!) but I haven’t quite got there yet. I still get
a pang of guilt each time I click ‘not attending’ and streams of
pictures from social events make me want to book the next flight
home.</p>

<div id="example" class="more para">

<h2>Everyone Seems to Have it Together When you Really Don’t</h2>

<p class = "para"> I live out of a backpack, spend 90% of my day
barefoot and I haven’t got any responsibilities (other than
having to wash my feet on the odd occasion).

Most of my friends have mortgages (I wouldn’t even know how to
apply for one of those and I still can’t work out how council
tax works), an endless stream of proposals has begun creeping
onto my timeline and one is getting married this year – a
wonderful and lifelong commitment that, quite frankly, terrifies me.

Instead of climbing the corporate ladder I’ve perfected my
downward dog. As they get numerous promotions I’ve been watching
the sunset from a surfboard. I like to think that I’m on a journey
of self-promotion and although my skill set doesn’t look much on
paper, I can haggle a mean price on a rickshaw and smell a scammer
a mile off - put that on your CV.</p>

<h2>Doubt + Overthinking = Frequent Breakdowns</h2>

<p class = "para">People might feel jealous when they scroll through my Instagram
feed, but it works both ways. Yes, I’m a free-range explorer with
little to responsibilities, but this ride can get old. Sometimes,
when I overthink, overanalyse and my mind goes into a wild frenzy,
I also wonder if I’m doing the right thing. Some days I crave the
stability of living in the U.K. I miss the stability of sleeping
in the same bed every night, living in a place where there are no
language barriers and having a constant support system around me.

It can feel as though I’m wasting time on the road and watching my
peers overtake me in every part of life is enough to freak anyone
out. However, after numerous breakdowns I’ve figured out that I
would be doing those sensible things if I wanted to. I could be
doing those things; there’s nothing stopping me settling down,
getting a job and buying John Lewis coasters, but life is all
about priorities and mine revolve around experiences. I have
this weird, uncontrollable desire to see the world, despite it
being a difficult and uncomfortable journey at times.</p>


<h2>Random Waves of Loneliness</h2>

<p class = "para"> Loneliness tends to strike at the strangest moments; when I’m
soaking up a great view or I’m eating something delicious. These
are the moments when I miss the people that I love and when I
crave peanut butter.

When loneliness strikes, past experience has taught me to curl up
with a book or start a conversation with a stranger. As if by
magic, the dark, gloomy cloud above me fizzles into a happy haze
and I forget about what I was worrying over in the first place.
These unexpected chats that throw you into another person’s life,
troubles and advice are lifesavers when you’re getting too wrapped
up in your own worries.</p>

<h2>Oh, the Goodbyes!</h2>

<p class = "para">Making friends on the road is bittersweet.

Remember that annoying song by that guy who called himself
Hellogoodbye? Well, he hit the nail on the head when it comes to
long-term travel.

I love to explore with other travellers, hear their stories and
tips, and even tag along with them for a while. During a recent
trip to Indonesia I met three different groups of friends and
saying our goodbyes was horrible! You eat, sleep, drink, laugh
and cry with complete strangers who become your closest friends
within a matter of days. They’re your pals who really get you and
understand the real side to travel (the 14 hour trains, squat
toilets and lazy days). However, your friendship is doomed from
the start. Reality has a way of biting you in the ass and your
different journeys, plans and ideas can’t be forced together, no
matter how much you want them to.

Saying goodbyes to my family and friends – both old and new – has
become easier as my journey goes on but my heart still breaks a
little bit each time I have to leave!</p>

<h2>You’ll Never Fit Back Into a 'Normal' Routine</h2>

<p class = "para"> My mind has broadened immeasurably – I’ve met
people, lost people, witnessed horrifying sights and experienced
amazing things that have changed me for good. However, the
majority of the people in my pre-travel life have remained the
same, which is both great and challenging.

<p class = "para"><b>Great</b> because the people that love me keep me grounded when
I contemplate running away to Guatemala despite being broke. They
encourage me to make positive choices because they love me and
want to see me happy. Hold on to these humans and treasure them
like your life depends on it. They are my portable support system
while I’m on the road and I need these time zone hopping babes to
pick up when I call at two a.m. just to hear a friendly voice.</p>

<p class = "para"><b>Challenging</b> because there will be opinions, comments and
conversations with people who try to pop your happy little travel
bubble.</p>

<p class = "para">I like to think that these people don’t know the damaging effects
of what they’re saying (or that they’re doing it at all). Maybe
they don’t realise how much strength it takes to leave on a solo
adventure, the physical and mental battles you face along the way
or the joy you’ve experienced living independently for the first
time. Whether they’re jealous, they’re looking out for you or your
safety is paramount to them, just remember why you chose to leave.
After two years of reassuring myself, making difficult decisions
and endless conversations about my career prospects, I’ve built a
magical filter that ignores the unsupportive comments.</p>

<p class = "para">When I’m lying in my childhood bedroom, my feet throbbing after a
long day working as a waitress in order to fund my next adventure,
I like to reflect on why I’m still pursuing this (sometimes) tricky lifestyle.
It’s not that I don’t want to be working on my career, saving for a mortgage
and building a grown up life like the rest of my friends, it’s because
nothing has stopped me yet.

Until it does, I'm going to enjoy the ride.</p>

<h1 id='blog2' class='title'>Six Top Spots Around Australia</h1>

<h2>Kings Park and Botanic Gardens | Perth</h2>

<p class = 'para'>This park sticks in my mind for one reason: the
view is one of a kind.

Perched to the side of Perth’s sprawling CBD skyline, it’s one
of the world’s biggest inner city parks and the Botanic Garden
is pretty spectacular! Boasting over 3,000 species of flora and
fauna, free daily-guided walks and loads of space, it’s a great
place for plant fanatics, fitness freaks and peace seekers.
There’s also a couple of cafés, a shaded play area for kids and
plenty of quiet, shady corners where you can lose yourself in a
book.

One of my favourite things to do is float through the treetops of
the Eucalyptus trees, suspended high above the vibrant canopy below.
Feeling adventurous? Head up there after dark and jump the barrier
to the canopy walk – you get the view to yourself and the view
over the city at night is magical!

Look out for: The giant Boab Tree. This guy travelled 3,200 kms
from the Kimberley region in 2008. Weighing over 36 tonnes,
reaching 14 metres high and spreading its branches to eight metres
wide, it was no easy job and cost in the region of $125,000.</p>

<h2>Cable Beach | Broome</h2>

<p class = 'para'>This huge sweep of sand has space for
everyone and it never feels crowded. The daytimes are filled
with families piling onto body boards or sheltering under
umbrellas, with the odd surfer popping up now and then.
Zanders café at the top is expensive but good, their aioli
is out of this world and their caramel milkshakes are the
perfect way to cool off when it gets too hot (which it will!)

Fact: you haven’t lived until you’ve seen a sunset on this
beach. Everyone in Broome’s sleepy town seems to congregate
here from about five each day so get there early to get a
parking space. Take a towel for a sunset dip and watch the
magic happen right before your eyes – just watch out for the
camels!</p>

<h2>Litchfield National Park | Darwin</h2>
<p class = 'para'>In comparison to Kakadu National Park
(aptly nicknamed Kadadon’t by many), Litchfield is like
the over achieving perfect little sister. Unless you have
a 4WD, Kakadu just isn’t worth the effort or the money in
my opinion. We visited Litchfield for two days and despite
not being able to access all of the major stops, it was a
great mini adventure!

First off, it’s free, so perfect for any budget travellers.
Secondly, there’s water everywhere and you can swim in it
if the season permits (and as long as there aren’t any
crocs about!) My favourite spot was Buley Rockhole that’s
made up of deep, clear pools of water where you can snooze
the afternoon away in the shade or jump off the rocky
ledges into the plunge pools.
<b>Note:</b> the campground fees are dependent on which site
you stay on and they use an honesty box system so have
change ready before you go.</p>

<h2>Lighthouse Trail | Byron Bay</h2>
<img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WqP7n_qcuFM/WJw8czSu1jI/AAAAAAAAAP4/WRRzT47wU9stTwNEfcZmJiZQTqczihrNwCLcB/s640/fullsizeoutput_1780.jpeg" alt="Wategos Beach Byron Bay" align="middle">

<p class = 'para'>Now this is a walk.

I completed it twice during my five-day break in Byron
and I was hideously hungover each time. As you stroll
along the white sand of Wategos Beach and watch as the
pod of dolphins sweep around the bay, your clouded head
will start to clear. Carrying on further up the hill,
there is a left turn. Take it. As you trundle down to
Cape Byron you’ll see its rugged point jutting out into
the water, and if you’ve got some patience and you’re
feeling lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of a
humpback whale. Watching two humpback whales cruise
around Australia’s most Easterly point was a serious
‘pinch-me’ moment that made me feel lucky to be in this
beautiful part of the world.

Best to leave early in the morning to beat the heat and
take a lot of water with you.</p>

<h2>Lord Nelson Brewery | The Rocks, Sydney</h2>

<p class = 'para'>Sydney’s area of cobbled streets, cosy
cafés and old school pubs that boast award winning
ales, incredible pork pies and a good dose of European
history.

The Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel sits happily in The
Rocks, a historically charming part of Sydney and the
first place of European settlement in Australia. Its
predecessor, the Fortune of War, which was shut down
and demolished during the plague outbreak and reopened
while The Lord Nelson stood strong, disputes its claim
to fame as Sydney’s oldest pub.

The microbrewery has been running for 30 years and now
produces some seriously great ales, two of which are
available in every good bottle-o: Three Sheets and Old
Admiral. Willy Smith, their own cider, also didn’t
fail to impress; crisp, dry and cold – is everything
you want from a cider and the best that I’ve had
outside of the West Country.</p>

<h2>Kalbarri National Park | WA</h2>

<p class = 'para'>An unexpected gem in northern WA.
Picture soaring sea cliffs, picture-perfect natural
sandstone creations and an abundance of natural
beauty at every turn. Visiting this National Park
was one of those spontaneous travel decisions that
actually paid off!

The highlight was the coastline; reaching up to 100m
above sea level, the rugged mainland hung above the
bright turquoise sea that was home to migrating
humpback whales. I sat and watched them as the
afternoon rolled on, mesmerised by their colossal
size and taking in the nature that surrounded me in
Kalbarri.

A walk to ‘Mushroom Rock’ is highly recommended too.
Sit on top of a giant rock as the waves crash against
the sandstone cliffs, spraying white foam high into
the air and the tide gently filters into the clear
rock pools below you. The beaches in the National
Park are unspoilt; stop off for a surf at Jurien Bay
or head down to an abandoned cove to watch the sunset
over the Indian Ocean.</p>

<h1 id='blog3' class='title'>When 2 Became 1: Adapting to Solo Female Travel</h1>
<p class = 'para'>There’s not really much worse than a break up.
  Apart from a break up that leaves you stranded on a farm in Australia,
  living in a purpose-built cabin half a world away from everyone who
  knows and loves you most. This is where I found myself last year. I
  had no plans but I did have some spare cash and I needed to escape -
  sharpish. So I turned to travel, the only thing that I could imagine
  making me even a teeny bit happy.</p>
  <p class = 'title'><a href="#" id="example3-show"class="showLink" onclick="showHide('example3');return false;"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>SEE MORE</a>
    <div id="example3" class="more">
      <p class = 'para'><b>Was I sure that travel was the right thing to turn to?</b>
        Not really. But I’d spent six deliriously happy, sun-soaked months
        adventuring in Southeast Asia the year before and it felt like the
        closest thing to home. I found myself on a flight to Bali just over a
        week later. I spent the six-hour flight staring into the back of the
        seat in front of me, my eyes red and puffy from the hysterical call with
        my mum before boarding. I didn’t understand why I was on that plane
        alone. Where was my travel buddy I’d been so used to having? Now I look
        back on that flight I can’t help but laugh, but that’s what the old
        cliché is all about: time really is the greatest healer, you just have
        to let it do its magic.

        So off I went, only to find out that doing it solo is a completely
        different ball game.
        <h2>Got chat?</h2>
        <p class ="para">The first thing that struck me was I had to speak to
          people. Turns out you can’t just rock up at a hostel and expect the
          people to flock to you, you’ve got to put yourself out there. At
          first, the thought of this horrified me; I spent my first night eating
          alone next to a guy who prayed to his food before eating it. I began
          to wonder if anyone would ever speak to me again and if I should also
          be worshipping my bowl of green curry … safe to say it was a weird night.

          Now that I’ve adapted to travelling alone I’ve had some of the
          funniest, most memorable experiences since I left home in 2015. I’ve
          met friends who’ve known me for years who are amazed at how good I am
          at talking to new people (which is weird because I still don’t feel
          very good at it). Ten-hour train journeys no longer faze me; I drive
          my own moped and I make every decision for myself. I’m travelling how
          I was always supposed to: independently, happily and freely.</p>

          <h2>Discover the Balance Between Effort and Ease</h2>
          <p class = "para"><b>Of course</b> I still have moments when it feels
            scary, uncomfortable and totally unnatural to strike up a
            conversation with a stranger but each time I do I’m still surprised
            at how easy it is to make lifelong friends within a matter of hours.</p>

            <p class = "para"><b>Of course</b> there are moments when I miss
              experiencing every step with my best friend, having someone to
              watch my bag for me or haggle when I don’t feel like it. Those
              moments are forgotten on days when I can scoot off to my favourite
              beach, rent a board and sip on a fresh coconut while watching the
              sunset without a care in the world.</p>

              <p class = "para"><b>Of course</b> there are times when I feel
                lonely, but those moments become less and less frequent, and
                even when they do swing by they’re less and less painful. Have
                you heard people say that when you’re on the road you’re never
                really alone… well that’s a real thing: during the last two
                month trip I took around Indonesia I spent a total of about ten
                days alone.</p>

                <p class = "para"><b>Of course</b> there are times when solo
                  travel can be really scary, lonely and intense. In those
                  situations I take a look around me, take three deep breaths
                  and realise that everyone else is in the same boat (and they
                  probably just want to make friends with you, too). Whether
                  I’ve just been smashed by a massive wave, in a really bad mood
                  or tumbling down a volcano, I always seem to befriend people
                  when I least expect to. These friendships are stronger than
                  any I made while travelling as a duo and I think that’s the
                  deal breaker for me: it makes the lows that can accompany solo
                  travel totally worth riding out, as you never know who’s
                  around the next corner.</p>

                  <p class = "para">I consider myself lucky to have travelled
                    both with and without a partner. I’ve experienced the ease
                    that comes with travelling in a pair and I’m learning
                    lessons from the challenges that solo travel throws at me on
                    a daily basis. I'm sure I've got more coming my way - watch
                    this space!</p>
