	<h1 class='title' id='about'>ABOUT ME</h1>


	<p class="para">Hey! I’m Sophie. I like being outside, learning new things and watching the
	sunset. I'm happiest when I've just completed an algorithm or I’m making someone smile.</p>

	<p class="para">For first time travelers, seasoned backpackers, solo sallies and best buds that
	are off to see the big wide world (or only my mum who's my #1 fan). I'd like to
	share a slice of my travel wisdom with you - but only if you promise to laugh
	along with me! I don't take myself too seriously, I sometimes spend all day
	worrying and I'm running away from everything that means I'm an adult. I've
	come to the conclusion that there's not much that travel won't teach you so I'm
	here to spread the word that I think its the absolute balls and probably the
	best thing you'll ever do, whether you've got a buddy or you're doing it alone!</p>

	<p class="para">Over the past two years I've been to nine different countries. My first
	backpacking ramble took me to Southeast Asia for six months before spending a year working in and
	travelling around Australia’s beautiful coast. I love the lifestyle over there and one day I hope
	to go back! While travelling I've had some once-in-a-lifetime experiences, learnt some serious
	life lessons and now I'm teaching myself to code.</p>


	<p class="para">My most recent adventure took me to India for four months where I was volunteering
	for a UN recognised women's empowerment organisation. This trip was horrifying and inspiring (and
	everything in between), and has spurred me to actively pursue a future role in a non-profit
	organisation.</p>

		<h1 class='title' id='blog1'>WHY IT SUCKS TO BE THE FRIEND WHO TRAVELS</h1>


		<p class="para">People don’t really talk about the negatives of long-term travel and I don’t know
		why. Perhaps they’re scared to complain while living it up on a beach in Bali because people will
		think they’re being ridiculous, but I want to set the record straight: long term travel has it’s
		downsides and I’d like to shed some light on my least favourite bits.</p>


		<h2>Missing Major Milestones</h2>


		<p class="para">I write this as my little sister’s 18th birthday is looming – a HUGE turning
		point in any teenager’s life – and I wont be there. Again. I’ve lost count of the celebrations
		that I’ve missed while I’ve been on my adventure – babies being born, weddings, funerals,
		heartbreaks, housewarmings, engagements – you name it, I’ve missed it.I’m sure my friends and
		family have adapted to my absence (it has been two years!) but I haven’t quite got there yet. I
		still get a pang of guilt each time I click ‘not attending’ and streams of pictures from social
		events make me want to book the next flight home.</p>

		<div class="more para" id="example">
			<h2>Everyone Seems to Have it Together When you Really Don’t</h2>


			<p class="para">I live out of a backpack, spend 90% of my day barefoot and I haven’t got any
			responsibilities (other than having to wash my feet on the odd occasion). Most of my friends
			have mortgages (I wouldn’t even know how to apply for one of those and I still can’t work out
			how council tax works), an endless stream of proposals has begun creeping onto my timeline and
			one is getting married this year – a wonderful and lifelong commitment that, quite frankly,
			terrifies me. Instead of climbing the corporate ladder I’ve perfected my downward dog. As they
			get numerous promotions I’ve been watching the sunset from a surfboard. I like to think that I’m
			on a journey of self-promotion and although my skill set doesn’t look much on paper, I can
			haggle a mean price on a rickshaw and smell a scammer a mile off - put that on your CV.</p>


			<h2>Doubt + Overthinking = Frequent Breakdowns</h2>


			<p class="para">People might feel jealous when they scroll through my Instagram feed, but it
			works both ways. Yes, I’m a free-range explorer with little to responsibilities, but this ride
			can get old. Sometimes, when I overthink, overanalyse and my mind goes into a wild frenzy, I
			also wonder if I’m doing the right thing. Some days I crave the stability of living in the U.K.
			I miss the stability of sleeping in the same bed every night, living in a place where there are
			no language barriers and having a constant support system around me. It can feel as though I’m
			wasting time on the road and watching my peers overtake me in every part of life is enough to
			freak anyone out. However, after numerous breakdowns I’ve figured out that I would be doing
			those sensible things if I wanted to. I could be doing those things; there’s nothing stopping me
			settling down, getting a job and buying John Lewis coasters, but life is all about priorities
			and mine revolve around experiences. I have this weird, uncontrollable desire to see the world,
			despite it being a difficult and uncomfortable journey at times.</p>


			<h2>Random Waves of Loneliness</h2>


			<p class="para">Loneliness tends to strike at the strangest moments; when I’m soaking up a great
			view or I’m eating something delicious. These are the moments when I miss the people that I love
			and when I crave peanut butter. When loneliness strikes, past experience has taught me to curl
			up with a book or start a conversation with a stranger. As if by magic, the dark, gloomy cloud
			above me fizzles into a happy haze and I forget about what I was worrying over in the first
			place. These unexpected chats that throw you into another person’s life, troubles and advice are
			lifesavers when you’re getting too wrapped up in your own worries.</p>


			<h2>Oh, the Goodbyes!</h2>


			<p class="para">Making friends on the road is bittersweet. Remember that annoying song by that
			guy who called himself Hellogoodbye? Well, he hit the nail on the head when it comes to
			long-term travel. I love to explore with other travellers, hear their stories and tips, and even
			tag along with them for a while. During a recent trip to Indonesia I met three different groups
			of friends and saying our goodbyes was horrible! You eat, sleep, drink, laugh and cry with
			complete strangers who become your closest friends within a matter of days. They’re your pals
			who really get you and understand the real side to travel (the 14 hour trains, squat toilets and
			lazy days). However, your friendship is doomed from the start. Reality has a way of biting you
			in the ass and your different journeys, plans and ideas can’t be forced together, no matter how
			much you want them to. Saying goodbyes to my family and friends – both old and new – has become
			easier as my journey goes on but my heart still breaks a little bit each time I have to
			leave!</p>


			<h2>You’ll Never Fit Back Into a 'Normal' Routine</h2>


			<p class="para">My mind has broadened immeasurably – I’ve met people, lost people, witnessed
			horrifying sights and experienced amazing things that have changed me for good. However, the
			majority of the people in my pre-travel life have remained the same, which is both great and
			challenging.</p>


			<p class="para"><b>Great</b> because the people that love me keep me grounded when I contemplate
			running away to Guatemala despite being broke. They encourage me to make positive choices
			because they love me and want to see me happy. Hold on to these humans and treasure them like
			your life depends on it. They are my portable support system while I’m on the road and I need
			these time zone hopping babes to pick up when I call at two a.m. just to hear a friendly
			voice.</p>


			<p class="para"><b>Challenging</b> because there will be opinions, comments and conversations
			with people who try to pop your happy little travel bubble.</p>


			<p class="para">I like to think that these people don’t know the damaging effects of what
			they’re saying (or that they’re doing it at all). Maybe they don’t realise how much strength it
			takes to leave on a solo adventure, the physical and mental battles you face along the way or
			the joy you’ve experienced living independently for the first time. Whether they’re jealous,
			they’re looking out for you or your safety is paramount to them, just remember why you chose to
			leave. After two years of reassuring myself, making difficult decisions and endless
			conversations about my career prospects, I’ve built a magical filter that ignores the
			unsupportive comments.</p>


			<p class="para">When I’m lying in my childhood bedroom, my feet throbbing after a long day
			working as a waitress in order to fund my next adventure, I like to reflect on why I’m still
			pursuing this (sometimes) tricky lifestyle. It’s not that I don’t want to be working on my
			career, saving for a mortgage and building a grown up life like the rest of my friends, it’s
			because nothing has stopped me yet. Until it does, I'm going to enjoy the ride.</p>

		<h1 class='title' id='blog2'>Six Top Spots Around Australia</h1>


		<h2>Kings Park and Botanic Gardens | Perth</h2>


		<p class='para'>This park sticks in my mind for one reason: the view is one of a kind. Perched to
		the side of Perth’s sprawling CBD skyline, it’s one of the world’s biggest inner city parks and
		the Botanic Garden is pretty spectacular! Boasting over 3,000 species of flora and fauna, free
		daily-guided walks and loads of space, it’s a great place for plant fanatics, fitness freaks and
		peace seekers. There’s also a couple of cafés, a shaded play area for kids and plenty of quiet,
		shady corners where you can lose yourself in a book. One of my favourite things to do is float
		through the treetops of the Eucalyptus trees, suspended high above the vibrant canopy below.
		Feeling adventurous? Head up there after dark and jump the barrier to the canopy walk – you get
		the view to yourself and the view over the city at night is magical! Look out for: The giant Boab
		Tree. This guy travelled 3,200 kms from the Kimberley region in 2008. Weighing over 36 tonnes,
		reaching 14 metres high and spreading its branches to eight metres wide, it was no easy job and
		cost in the region of $125,000.</p>

			<h2>Cable Beach | Broome</h2>


			<p class='para'>This huge sweep of sand has space for everyone and it never feels crowded. The
			daytimes are filled with families piling onto body boards or sheltering under umbrellas, with
			the odd surfer popping up now and then. Zanders café at the top is expensive but good, their
			aioli is out of this world and their caramel milkshakes are the perfect way to cool off when it
			gets too hot (which it will!) Fact: you haven’t lived until you’ve seen a sunset on this beach.
			Everyone in Broome’s sleepy town seems to congregate here from about five each day so get there
			early to get a parking space. Take a towel for a sunset dip and watch the magic happen right
			before your eyes – just watch out for the camels!</p>

			<h2>Litchfield National Park | Darwin</h2>


			<p class='para'>In comparison to Kakadu National Park (aptly nicknamed Kadadon’t by many),
			Litchfield is like the over achieving perfect little sister. Unless you have a 4WD, Kakadu just
			isn’t worth the effort or the money in my opinion. We visited Litchfield for two days and
			despite not being able to access all of the major stops, it was a great mini adventure! First
			off, it’s free, so perfect for any budget travellers. Secondly, there’s water everywhere and you
			can swim in it if the season permits (and as long as there aren’t any crocs about!) My favourite
			spot was Buley Rockhole that’s made up of deep, clear pools of water where you can snooze the
			afternoon away in the shade or jump off the rocky ledges into the plunge pools. <b>Note:</b> the
			campground fees are dependent on which site you stay on and they use an honesty box system so
			have change ready before you go.</p>

			<h2>Lighthouse Trail | Byron Bay</h2>

			<p class='para'>Now this is a walk. I completed it twice during my five-day break in Byron and I
			was hideously hungover each time. As you stroll along the white sand of Wategos Beach and watch
			as the pod of dolphins sweep around the bay, your clouded head will start to clear. Carrying on
			further up the hill, there is a left turn. Take it. As you trundle down to Cape Byron you’ll see
			its rugged point jutting out into the water, and if you’ve got some patience and you’re feeling
			lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of a humpback whale. Watching two humpback whales cruise
			around Australia’s most Easterly point was a serious ‘pinch-me’ moment that made me feel lucky
			to be in this beautiful part of the world. Best to leave early in the morning to beat the heat
			and take a lot of water with you.</p>

			<h2>Lord Nelson Brewery | The Rocks, Sydney</h2>


			<p class='para'>Sydney’s area of cobbled streets, cosy cafés and old school pubs that boast
			award winning ales, incredible pork pies and a good dose of European history. The Lord Nelson
			Brewery Hotel sits happily in The Rocks, a historically charming part of Sydney and the first
			place of European settlement in Australia. Its predecessor, the Fortune of War, which was shut
			down and demolished during the plague outbreak and reopened while The Lord Nelson stood strong,
			disputes its claim to fame as Sydney’s oldest pub. The microbrewery has been running for 30
			years and now produces some seriously great ales, two of which are available in every good
			bottle-o: Three Sheets and Old Admiral. Willy Smith, their own cider, also didn’t fail to
			impress; crisp, dry and cold – is everything you want from a cider and the best that I’ve had
			outside of the West Country.</p>

			<h2>Kalbarri National Park | WA</h2>


			<p class='para'>An unexpected gem in northern WA. Picture soaring sea cliffs, picture-perfect
			natural sandstone creations and an abundance of natural beauty at every turn. Visiting this
			National Park was one of those spontaneous travel decisions that actually paid off! The
			highlight was the coastline; reaching up to 100m above sea level, the rugged mainland hung above
			the bright turquoise sea that was home to migrating humpback whales. I sat and watched them as
			the afternoon rolled on, mesmerised by their colossal size and taking in the nature that
			surrounded me in Kalbarri. A walk to ‘Mushroom Rock’ is highly recommended too. Sit on top of a
			giant rock as the waves crash against the sandstone cliffs, spraying white foam high into the
			air and the tide gently filters into the clear rock pools below you. The beaches in the National
			Park are unspoilt; stop off for a surf at Jurien Bay or head down to an abandoned cove to watch
			the sunset over the Indian Ocean.</p>

		<h1 class='title' id='blog3'>When 2 Became 1: Adapting to Solo Female Travel</h1>


		<p class='para'>There’s not really much worse than a break up. Apart from a break up that leaves
		you stranded on a farm in Australia, living in a purpose-built cabin half a world away from
		everyone who knows and loves you most. This is where I found myself last year. I had no plans but
		I did have some spare cash and I needed to escape - sharpish. So I turned to travel, the only
		thing that I could imagine making me even a teeny bit happy.</p>


		<p class='title'><a class="showLink" href="#" id="example3-show" onclick=
		"showHide('example3');return false;"><i aria-hidden="true" class=
		"fa fa-angle-double-down"></i>SEE MORE</a>
		</p>


		<div class="more" id="example3">
			<p class='para'><b>Was I sure that travel was the right thing to turn to?</b> Not really. But
			I’d spent six deliriously happy, sun-soaked months adventuring in Southeast Asia the year before
			and it felt like the closest thing to home. I found myself on a flight to Bali just over a week
			later. I spent the six-hour flight staring into the back of the seat in front of me, my eyes red
			and puffy from the hysterical call with my mum before boarding. I didn’t understand why I was on
			that plane alone. Where was my travel buddy I’d been so used to having? Now I look back on that
			flight I can’t help but laugh, but that’s what the old cliché is all about: time really is the
			greatest healer, you just have to let it do its magic. So off I went, only to find out that
			doing it solo is a completely different ball game.</p>


			<h2>Got chat?</h2>


			<p class="para">The first thing that struck me was I had to speak to people. Turns out you can’t
			just rock up at a hostel and expect the people to flock to you, you’ve got to put yourself out
			there. At first, the thought of this horrified me; I spent my first night eating alone next to a
			guy who prayed to his food before eating it. I began to wonder if anyone would ever speak to me
			again and if I should also be worshipping my bowl of green curry … safe to say it was a weird
			night. Now that I’ve adapted to travelling alone I’ve had some of the funniest, most memorable
			experiences since I left home in 2015. I’ve met friends who’ve known me for years who are amazed
			at how good I am at talking to new people (which is weird because I still don’t feel very good
			at it). Ten-hour train journeys no longer faze me; I drive my own moped and I make every
			decision for myself. I’m travelling how I was always supposed to: independently, happily and
			freely.</p>


			<h2>Discover the Balance Between Effort and Ease</h2>


			<p class="para"><b>Of course</b> I still have moments when it feels scary, uncomfortable and
			totally unnatural to strike up a conversation with a stranger but each time I do I’m still
			surprised at how easy it is to make lifelong friends within a matter of hours.</p>


			<p class="para"><b>Of course</b> there are moments when I miss experiencing every step with my
			best friend, having someone to watch my bag for me or haggle when I don’t feel like it. Those
			moments are forgotten on days when I can scoot off to my favourite beach, rent a board and sip
			on a fresh coconut while watching the sunset without a care in the world.</p>


			<p class="para"><b>Of course</b> there are times when I feel lonely, but those moments become
			less and less frequent, and even when they do swing by they’re less and less painful. Have you
			heard people say that when you’re on the road you’re never really alone… well that’s a real
			thing: during the last two month trip I took around Indonesia I spent a total of about ten days
			alone.</p>


			<p class="para"><b>Of course</b> there are times when solo travel can be really scary, lonely
			and intense. In those situations I take a look around me, take three deep breaths and realise
			that everyone else is in the same boat (and they probably just want to make friends with you,
			too). Whether I’ve just been smashed by a massive wave, in a really bad mood or tumbling down a
			volcano, I always seem to befriend people when I least expect to. These friendships are stronger
			than any I made while travelling as a duo and I think that’s the deal breaker for me: it makes
			the lows that can accompany solo travel totally worth riding out, as you never know who’s around
			the next corner.</p>


			<p class="para">I consider myself lucky to have travelled both with and without a partner. I’ve
			experienced the ease that comes with travelling in a pair and I’m learning lessons from the
			challenges that solo travel throws at me on a daily basis. I'm sure I've got more coming my way
			- watch this space!</p>
